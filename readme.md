Code Fellows 201 stretch assignment

assignment:
"- Create a repository named `front-end-ui`, with a verbose `README.md` file and an appropriate open source `LICENSE`.
 - Within the repository, create a directory called `day11-registration`. Do all your work for this assignment in that directory.
 - Create a branch from `master` that is *also* called `day11-registration`
-- **Give yourself no more than 75 minutes of time and do your best to replicate the page, buttons and all. Submit the result even if you don't finish, just go with whatever you managed to build in that time.**
+- **Give yourself no more than 1.5 hours of time and do your best to replicate the page, buttons and all. Submit the result even if you don't finish, just go with whatever you managed to build in that time.**
 - Don't make the form functional, just replicate the UI to the best of your ability.
 - Within the `README.md`, note your start time and your end time for your work on this assignment
+- You may want to use an application to keep strict track of your time. [iCheckClock](http://en.freedownloadmanager.org/Mac-OS/iCheckClock-FREE.html) is a great application for Mac computers that serves this purpose."
